# Changelog

Every push to the repository adds an entry at the top: date and time (US Central), what changed, and the commit(s).
Nightly "Refresh data" commits from the data workflow are left out (they only update `data/`).

## 2026-10-02

### 4:25 PM CT: Market data merged to main, map buttons stay clear of open cards, basemap names
- With a filing or building card open, the map buttons on the right (zoom, compass, locate, home, time-lapse, layers, globe) and the Layers panel move left of the card, like the Ask AI button, so a tall card no longer hides them.
- Basemap buttons renamed: "Dot Grid" is now **Default**, "Esri Sat" is now **ESRI** (the Sources tab and the assistant use the same names).
- Added this changelog.
- Merged the Market view branch and the Ask AI suggestions branch into main, so main has everything below.

### 3:36 PM CT: Market view and registered businesses (11ded4b)
- New **Market** tab: population, jobs, housing units permitted, new business locations and local development news per county or the whole region, with hover readouts and tables.
- New **Jobs** demographic layers on the map: jobs located here, job growth, jobs per resident (US Census LEHD LODES).
- Building cards list businesses registered at the parcel address (Texas Comptroller sales-tax permits); filing cards have a **Look Up Registered Businesses** button.
- Nightly build adds `data/area.json`: LODES jobs, Census Building Permits Survey, Comptroller new businesses, Google News area headlines. Each source is best effort.
- AI briefs include county permits and jobs; Sources tab and README list the new sources and their limits.

### 3:27 PM CT: Ask AI suggestions and keyboard shortcuts (8d294c6); geocoding retries (c07c5fc)
- Up to 5 suggested questions above Ask AI, based on what's on screen (the open filing or building, the town in view, the filters). With a card open, Ask AI and its suggestions sit left of the card instead of under it.
- Cmd/Ctrl+K focuses the map search; Cmd/Ctrl+/ opens and closes the assistant. Key hints shown on desktop.
- Building card: Select Multiple only on touch screens; with a mouse, Shift-click adds buildings and parcels.
- Geocoding retries cached misses and places addresses that have no usable house number.

### 3:17 PM CT: Project news from Google News (9f78567, 817338f)
- News searches Google News first, GDELT as a fallback (GDELT was refusing or rate-limiting the site's server).
- One-word company names get construction context added so the search finds the right company.

### 3:14 PM CT: High-res site imagery (e064153)
- Site Imagery shows dated sub-metre aerial versions from the Esri World Imagery archive (Wayback) and USDA NAIP, alongside NASA's 30 m passes.

### 3:10 PM CT: Data pipeline fixes (f6d574b, ddb95f9)

### 2:59 PM CT: Assistant and map fixes (6e9e070, 6bda349, 80112c3)
- Assistant stops detouring to the wrong street, adds a "Tell me more" pill, wider drawer.
- The open filing always shows on the map, even when filters would hide it.
- Downtown zooms stop at district level; outlines no longer jump to the globe.

### 2:52 PM CT: Search, camera, list and Sources tab; team notes without sign-in (e2bdf41, 617d1fd)
- Fixed address search and the 3D camera getting stuck; the list panel is resizable; new **Sources** tab with every data source and how fresh it is.
- Team field notes sync through `/api/field` with no sign-in (optional team passcode).

### 2:43 PM CT: Button labels, NASA previews, drive routes (73495ab)
- Title Case buttons; NASA image previews with download; the drive route clears when the card closes.

- Map search with place outlines, Compare areas, custom metrics, export dialog, costs with cents.

### 1:02 PM CT: Assistant camera and statewide fix (4cb2456, 8a6e0cf)
